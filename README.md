# Amazon-Product-Sales-Data-Project
This project analyzes Amazon product sales data to uncover insights into pricing, ratings, reviews, and category performance. Using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, we identify trends in customer behavior, the impact of discounts and promotions, and the top-performing product categories.
